                <h4>Education</h4>
                <p> I am a masters student at UCL studying linguistics with a specialisation in pragmatics. Prior to my masters degree, I graduated from the University of Brighton with a first class honours in linguistics. </p>
                <h4>Music</h4>
                <p> In my spare time I produce ambient electronic music. I also produce dense sprawling chiptune-esque tracks. This production occurs under a few monikers but all can be found <a href="https://mthyr.bandcamp.com">here</a>. I have in the past operated an online record label (netlabel) called <a href="https://questionrecords.bandcamp.com">Question Records</a>. It is currently on indefinite hiatus whilst I focus on the more present and important parts of life.</p>
                <h4>Interests</h4>
                <p> I have several interests in and out of academia. Listed below are my non-academic interests. For academic interests, please see 'Academia' below.</p>

                <h4>Academia</h4>
                <p> I am enthralled by the pragmatics of emotion, music perception and the more cognitive aspects and research in lingustics. See below for a non-exhaustive list of my academic interests:</p>

                        <li>emotion (philosophical, cognitive and pragmatic)</li>
